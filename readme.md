# CodeCreative Static Site - Hugo

This repo contains the Hugo directories used to build the CodeCreative.io static site.

## Todo

- Add search capabilities using Lunr and a pre-generated index
- Create a tags/categories Taxonomy to support both ServiceNow and Non-ServiceNow content

## For Consideration

- Course content on static site
- Challenges and Scenarios to provide real world examples for developers to practice on and hone skills

## About Travis

Hi, I'm Travis Toulson and I started this whole CodeCreative thing. When I was transitioning from working in maintenance and production to IT, I faced a lot of challenges breaking in. Information was hard to find unless you already knew what to look for and people were generally unhelpful. I was often told that if I couldn’t figure “this or that” out then I should just give up. Because of this, it took me around 5 years just to learn to code and a few more years to cross into IT. When I was at rock bottom, I promised myself that if I made it, I would do everything I could to hold the door open for others.

Thanks to the ServiceNow Community, it's members, and an amazing group of mentors and recruiters, I have been given an opportunity better than I ever imagined. Following through on my commitment, I use CodeCreative to share educational content to help people start and grow their careers on the ServiceNow platform.

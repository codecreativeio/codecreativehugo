## About Travis

Hi, I'm Travis Toulson and I started this whole CodeCreative thing.  I have a passion for well designed software that serves people.  I am currently a ServiceNow Developer by trade, but believe it or not IT is my second career.  I spent my first 7 years working in equipment maintenance and manufacturing.  And like most workers / supervisors, I hated the software I was forced to use.  It was often slow, hard to navigate, and seemed designed for any except the purposes for which I was instructed to use it.

Never one for idle complaining, I learned to code in order to be part of the solution.  Now, I use some of my spare time to help other developers navigate their journey and find creative business solutions.

*This week I am excited to bring back Michael Green to discuss Nelson Frank's first market trends and salary survey report. Whenever I talk to Michael or his team I end up discussing market trends, which locations are hot for ServiceNow, and how salaries are trending. I love sharing insights with the team at Nelson Frank, especially since most online tools have a hard time differentiating between the general IT market and the ServiceNow niche. Reliable information can be hard to come by. I've personally already [taken the survey][1] and am looking forward to the results. Without further ado, I welcome back Michael Green, Vice President at Nelson Frank. - Travis Toulson*

## Share your ServiceNow thoughts in Nelson Frank’s market trends report

The future is very bright for ServiceNow. The platform continues to evolve, introducing new products and workflows to match the needs of businesses, which means it's going to be around for the foreseeable future.

Keeping on top of the latest trends can be tricky, especially when a product is seeing rapid growth. If you use, or are considering, ServiceNow, then detailed insight into the most popular products, info from your peers about the sector, and an understanding of the earning potential can be a lifesaver.

To help answer all your questions and help you make the right career move, Nelson Frank is compiling its first market trends and salary survey report which promises to be the largest independent study of ServiceNow.

Taking the survey gives you the chance to share your thoughts on the dynamic ServiceNow community, and by sharing your experiences of the platform, workflows, and the ecosystem, you’ll be helping to make the report as accurate and detailed as possible.

We want to know how professionals feel about their workplace environment, the top industry certifications, benefits they receive, the most prominent trends expected to hit ServiceNow in 2019 and beyond, and of course the salaries for each role.

The survey closes on March 29, 2019, so there is only a limited amount of time to submit your views on ServiceNow, ITSM and the industry as a whole.  

It’ll take ten minutes to complete, and for sharing your views on ServiceNow and ITSM, you have the chance to win a $500 Amazon gift card. If you want to be part of the most comprehensive review of the ServiceNow landscape, you can [take the survey now][1].

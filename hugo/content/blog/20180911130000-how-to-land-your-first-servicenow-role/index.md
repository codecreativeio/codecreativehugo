Breaking into a new sector or area of IT is never easy, but with so many opportunities available in ServiceNow perhaps it’s time you made a change. 

ServiceNow is the fastest-growing IT platform in the marketplace, with [Gartner][1] projecting its market share at double that of its nearest competitor in its latest research. Forbes also recently announced it as the world’s most innovative company. 

So if you’re looking for extra advice to kickstart your ServiceNow journey, here are some handy pointers to help you land your first role. 

## Step one: Get started on the Developer Portal

Getting started in ServiceNow is easier than you think. Simply head over to its [Developer Portal][2] and sign up for your free account. 

When your account is up and running, it's time to make the decision on which path is right for you. There are a couple of options available, but if you’re a total novice, it’s recommended you register for the ‘New to ServiceNow’ learning path. 

On the other hand, if you have previous IT knowledge and you’re looking to switch sectors, sign yourself up for a more advanced course. 

When you’re ready to begin the learning process, you’ll need to get yourself a personal developer instance. This is where you'll complete your training and enhance your skills before stepping into the real world. 

## Step two: Pick your ServiceNow specialism

Before committing to a ServiceNow role, you need to decide on the area you want to specialize in. The platform itself is continuing to grow with the launch of London and Kingston, so if you have a specific area in mind, we advise you streamline your training towards that.

After you've completed the first course, it's time to make a vital decision about that specialism, and decide whether to continue with administrator or developer training.

Both courses have their merits, but if you favor an area of IT management or development, choosing the right course can lead to better job prospects. When it comes to the roles, many will enable you to break into the sector, and ServiceNow Admin, Portal Developer, and Implementation Specialists are a good starting point.   

But with the ever-expanding nature of the technology, we can guarantee you'll never be short of opportunities. 

## Step three: Exercise your skill

Whether you’re an expert developer or fresh out of training, it’s vitally important to keep your skills up to date. Just because you’ve completed a course, it doesn’t mean the learning stops there.

We’re not saying you’re completely cut adrift when you’ve finished your training. But it's time to get yourself out there and gain practical experience, all of which can be a key in helping you to land your first role. 

Employers value practical experience, so show off something you’ve built in your developer portal. It could be a new tool or a rebuild of a previous project, but either way, it’ll offer a better insight into your ability.  

But if you still need extra help, then sign up to community blogs or get yourself a Reddit account and speak to like-minded people. 

## Step four: Get yourself hired

It seems a logical step, but now you have the knowledge and practical experience, it's time to land yourself a ServiceNow job.

There are many paths you can take to find the perfect job, but you can't rest on your laurels, as they won't come to you. 

Do your research and find out which businesses already use the technology—if they have an entry-level position, this could be the perfect role. 

You can also search for ServiceNow partners and see if they have an office nearby. A foot in the door in these types of businesses can lead to a lucrative career, so if you do land an interview, make sure you're prepared. 

If that isn't right for you, then why not consider standing on your own two feet and trying contract work. ServiceNow is a niche specialty, but be careful as you could end up with more work than you can handle 

## Step five: Get yourself certified

All consultants working at a partner now need certifications to work on projects. If you are working at an end user it would be very attractive to potential employers if you had a certification showing your skill set.  

Adding this extra string to your bow can make you an indispensable asset, as they'll not only give a mastery of a specialist area, they can also help you stand out in the job market. 

One thing you’ll need to remember is that [ServiceNow certifications][3] don’t come cheap. But some businesses do offer them as incentives to join their team, as the more skills you have, the more beneficial it will be for them. 

## Bonus Insight: Get connected

ServiceNow is always changing, so if you want to know the latest news and views, then it's time to jump on social media and follow the experts. 

Twitter and Linkedin have become very powerful tools in every industry, opening up doors for engagement. So connect with the experts and industry leaders and read their content, as every article and comment can add to your education. 

## Conclusion

The ServiceNow industry has so much potential and growth opportunity for those looking to move into the industry but the sector is only as good as the people who work in it. So if you’re ready to make a move, get yourself signed up to a developer portal and start your learning today.

## Review

### Instance Versions

Since each customer owns their own instance of ServiceNow, customers have the flexibility of choosing when to upgrade their instance to the latest version of ServiceNow. Currently, ServiceNow releases a new version roughly once to twice a year and releases maintenance patches as needed.

Most often, when selecting a Personal Developer Instance version, you will want to select the most recent version. At the time of this writing, that would be **Madrid** for PDIs but **London** for general release. Don't worry if you pick the wrong version for your PDI, though, you can always upgrade your instance after obtaining it.

ServiceNow's current naming convention is to name releases in alphabetical order using the name of a world city.  For example, these are the releases and planned releases using this convention so far:

- Aspen (2011)
- Berlin (2012)
- Calgary (2013)
- Dublin (2013)
- Eureka (2014)
- Fuji (2015)
- Geneva (2015)
- Helsinki (2016)
- Istanbul (2017)
- Jakarta (2017)
- Kingston (2018)
- London (2018)
- Madrid (Planned for Q1 2019)
- New York (Planned for Q3 2019)
- Orlando (Planned for Q1 2020)
- Paris (Planned for Q3 2020)

### Remaining Inactivity

Sadly, your Personal Developer Instance is not made to last forever.  ServiceNow has taken two steps to ensure they can provide as many free instances for our use as possible.  First, instances will fall asleep (or hibernate) when inactive for a period of time.  When you attempt to access a hibernating instance, it will have to 'wake up' first which can take a few minutes.  The second step is to reclaim unused instances after a set inactive period indicated by Remaining Inactivity.  If your instance is reclaimed, all work in it is lost.  So make sure to visit your developer instance periodically to keep it active.

[(Return to Step 6)][4]

### Reset Instance Password

Use any application long enough and you are bound to forget your password and lock yourself out eventually. Fortunately, ServiceNow makes it easy to reset your password on your Personal Developer Instance. If you go back to the **My Instance** page from [Step 6][4], you can click the button named **Action** to get a list of options. From the dropdown, click **Reset admin password**.

Take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the other options as well. Try them out, you can always release your instance and get a new one later.

**Warning:** You may have to wait 15 minutes to get a new instance and your preferred instance version may not be available.

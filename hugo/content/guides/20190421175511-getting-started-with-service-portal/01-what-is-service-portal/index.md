Service Portal is a powerful framework for building self-service websites and custom web app UIs. Using a hierarchy of table driven components, Service Portal simplifies the process and reduces the code required to build a web interface.

## Building Blocks

The Service Portal framework uses a combination of well known web libraries and unique framework building blocks to power the UI.

For front-end web developers, a few libraries are in use which are likely familiar:

- AngularJS (version 1.x)
- Bootstrap (version 3.x)
- Font Awesome (version 4.7)

Familiar as these may be, however, the framework exposes a very rigid set of components and defined practices for building portals and their pages. In a sense, Service Portal is it's own build tool which results in some unfamiliar development practices. With time and practice, these differences from traditional UI development are easy to overcome and can yield significant productivity improvements in most cases.

Throughout this guide, we will explore each of the major components of the Service Portal framework and get a foundational understanding of each.

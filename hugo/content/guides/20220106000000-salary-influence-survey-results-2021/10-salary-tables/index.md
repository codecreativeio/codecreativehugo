## Role Based Salary Tables

The following salary tables were generated directly from the survey responses without considering any outside data. The findings of the survey indicate that these salary tables are not actually the most effective way to predict compensation. In order to maintain consistency with traditional salary table based approaches, the decision was made to include the job titles in the tables. Country and role breakdowns with too few responses submitted were omitted both to preserve anonymity and to reduce the risk of publishing skewed data. These values are based solely on the data submitted and may be inaccurate due to sample bias.

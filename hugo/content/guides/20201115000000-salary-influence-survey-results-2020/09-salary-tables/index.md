## Role Based Salary Tables

The following salary tables were generated directly from the survey responses without considering any outside data. Based on the findings of the analysis, years of experience is the strongest predictor in determining which quartile an individual is most likely to fall into. Depending on the country, the particular experience can vary. For the United States and Australia, ServiceNow experience was most correlated with compensation. For India, IT experience was most relevant. Lastly, for the United Kingdom and Canada, total experience was most informative. Additionally, for United States based workers, variable compensation (bonus, hourly, etc) of more than 25% of total compensation increases the probability of being compensated in the upper half of the scale.

The findings of the survey indicate that job title is technically irrelevant but strongly correlated with years of experience. In order to maintain consistency with traditional salary table based approaches, the decision was made to include the job titles in the tables. Country and role breakdowns with too few responses submitted were omitted both to preserve anonymity and to reduce the risk of publishing skewed data.
